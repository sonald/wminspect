# Rust 2024 Edition Migration Progress

## Completed Items

### 1. Edition Update ✅
- Added `edition = "2024"` to Cargo.toml
- Updated package metadata

### 2. Dependency Updates ✅
- **clap**: Updated from 2.27 to 4.x
  - Migrated from `App` to `Command`
  - Updated argument parsing from `from_usage` to `Arg::new()` 
  - Changed `is_present()` to `get_flag()` for boolean flags
  - Updated `value_of()` to `get_one::<String>()`
  - Updated `values_of()` to `get_many::<String>()`
  
- **bincode**: Updated from 1.x to 2.x
  - Changed `deserialize_from()` to `deserialize()`
  - Changed `serialize_into()` to `serialize()` with manual write
  
- **timer**: Replaced with crossbeam-channel
  - Added crossbeam-channel and crossbeam crates
  - Updated channel usage to use `unbounded()` instead of `mpsc::channel()`
  
- **xcb-util**: Updated to 0.4 with required features
  - Added features: `["ewmh", "keysyms", "icccm"]`
  
- **serde**: Added derive feature for automatic serialization
  - Added `serde = { version = "1.0", features = ["derive"] }`
  - Added `Serialize` and `Deserialize` imports to files

### 3. Code Updates ✅
- Updated import statements in main.rs and wm modules
- Fixed clap API usage throughout the codebase
- Added proper serde derives and imports
- Updated CHANGELOG.md with migration notes

## Remaining Issues ⚠️

### 1. XCB API Compatibility
The main blocker is the XCB library API changes. The current code uses:
- `xcb::xproto::*` (now private module)
- Various XCB types that have moved to `xcb::x::*`
- Legacy XCB function calls that need updating

### 2. FFI and Low-level Types
- `xcb::ffi::xcb_configure_notify_event_t` - FFI types may have changed
- Event casting functions need updating
- Window manager protocol constants need updating

### 3. Build System
- `build.rs` may need updates for new XCB bindings
- Links configuration may need adjustment

## Next Steps

1. **XCB Migration**: Choose between:
   - Updating to use `xcb` 1.x API with `xcb::x::*` imports
   - Migrating to `x11rb` as suggested in the original task
   - Finding compatible xcb-util version

2. **Test Compilation**: 
   - Fix all compilation errors
   - Run `cargo clippy --fix` 
   - Run `cargo fmt`

3. **Runtime Testing**:
   - Test basic functionality
   - Verify X11 window manager integration still works
   - Test serialization/deserialization with new bincode

## Migration Strategy Recommendation

Given the complexity of the XCB API changes, I recommend:

1. **Phase 1**: Complete the current xcb 1.x migration
   - Fix all import paths to use `xcb::x::*` 
   - Update FFI usage and constants
   - Ensure compilation succeeds

2. **Phase 2**: Consider x11rb migration later
   - x11rb provides a more modern, safe API
   - Would be a larger refactor but better long-term
   - Could be done in a separate task

The current state represents significant progress on the Rust 2024 edition migration, with most dependency updates complete and the main remaining work being XCB API compatibility.
